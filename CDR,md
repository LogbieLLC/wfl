Critical Design Review (CDR) Plan for WFL
Purpose
The purpose of this CDR is to evaluate the design of WFL comprehensively, ensuring it is free from critical issues that could compromise its functionality or stability. This static review analyzes the codebase without execution, targeting potential defects such as:

    Memory Leaks: Unreleased allocated memory that accumulates over time.
    Infinite Loops: Loops that fail to terminate, potentially freezing the system.
    Data Loss: Scenarios where data could be unintentionally lost or corrupted (a severe showstopper requiring immediate resolution).
    Concurrency Issues: Deadlocks or borrow errors in asynchronous code.
    Unsafe Code: Improper use of unsafe blocks or Foreign Function Interface (FFI).

Review Process
The CDR follows a structured and consistent approach for every review:

    Pre-Step: Machine Checks:
        Run cargo clippy --all -- -D warnings to catch common issues.
        Run cargo udeps to identify unused dependencies.
        Run cargo geiger to detect unsafe code usage.
    Static Review:
        At least two passes are conducted per CDR, analyzing source code (src.txt) and documentation (docs.txt) without runtime execution.
        Additional passes are performed if Critical or Major issues remain after the second pass.
        Each pass is time-boxed: 90 minutes for AI analysis + 30 minutes for human triage.
    Consistency: The same review routine (detailed below) is applied to every CDR for uniformity and thoroughness.
    Artifacts: Each pass produces a markdown file (e.g., cdr_pass1.md) stored in docs/cdr/, summarizing findings, status, and next steps.
    CI Integration: Continuous Integration (CI) verifies CDR artifacts exist and checks for unresolved Critical/Major issues (e.g., grep for [ ] Critical checkboxes).

Reviewer Roles & Sign-Off Gates

    Primary Reviewer: AI (performs initial analysis).
    Human Lead: Senior developer or architect (reviews findings, triages issues).
    Maintainer: Final approver (ensures all Critical issues are resolved).
    Sign-Off Criteria:
        All Critical issues resolved (Red = 0).
        Major issues ≤ 2 (Yellow ≤ 2).
        Project does not advance phases until all Critical issues are closed.

Key Focus Areas
The review prioritizes these critical aspects of the WFL design:

    Memory Leaks
        Identify unreleased allocated memory (e.g., in Rc<RefCell<...>> structures).
        Check for cyclic references.
    Infinite Loops
        Detect loops without proper termination conditions.
        Assess recursive functions for infinite recursion risks.
    Data Loss
        Ensure no operations overwrite or discard data unintentionally.
        Verify robust error handling to prevent corruption.
    Concurrency Issues
        Check for deadlocks or borrow errors in async code (e.g., RefCell misuse).
    Unsafe Code
        Ensure unsafe blocks or FFI usage are justified with safety comments.
    Efficiency
        Evaluate algorithms for performance bottlenecks (e.g., O(n²) complexity).
        Check scalability with large inputs (e.g., 10,000 tokens).
    Error Handling
        Confirm comprehensive error handling to prevent crashes.
        Validate recovery or graceful failure in error scenarios.
    Security
        Identify vulnerabilities (e.g., unsanitized inputs).
        Ensure file paths are canonicalized to prevent path traversal.
    Log Management
        Prevent uncontrolled log growth or unconditional file operations.

Grading System
Issues are categorized using this grading system:

    Critical (Red)  
        Description: Issues causing system failure, data loss, or security breaches.
        Action: Must be addressed immediately. If unresolved after the third pass, new feature work freezes, and a hot-fix sprint is scheduled.
        Examples: Data loss, infinite loops with no exit, memory leaks in core components.
    Major (Yellow)  
        Description: Issues significantly impacting performance or functionality without halting the system.
        Action: Should be resolved before final approval; temporary workarounds may be acceptable short-term.
        Examples: Excessive memory usage, inefficient loop design, missing error handling for non-critical cases.
    Minor (Green)  
        Description: Cosmetic or minimal-impact issues.
        Action: Can be addressed in future iterations.
        Examples: Unnecessary variable declarations, inconsistent formatting.
    Informational (Blue)  
        Description: Optional improvement suggestions.
        Action: Enhancements for future consideration.
        Examples: Potential optimizations, alternative design choices.

Review Checklist
This checklist guides the static review process:
Memory Management

    Are all allocated resources (e.g., Rc<RefCell<...>>, file handles) explicitly released?
    Are there cyclic references in data structures (e.g., Value::List, Value::Object)?
    Do recursive functions manage stack growth properly?

Loop Constructs

    Are termination conditions for loops (while, for, forever) clearly defined and achievable?
    Can external inputs or edge cases cause infinite loops?
    Are recursive calls guaranteed to terminate?
    Are timeouts configured (e.g., in REPL) to prevent indefinite hangs?

Data Handling

    Are data structures manipulated to preserve integrity?
    Do file I/O operations safeguard against data loss?
    Are assignments/updates free from unintended overwrites?
    Are file paths canonicalized to prevent vulnerabilities?

Algorithm Efficiency

    Are algorithms optimized for large inputs (e.g., avoid O(n²) with n = 10,000 tokens)?
    Are there bottlenecks (e.g., nested loops, excessive cloning)?

Error Handling

    Are all error conditions caught and handled?
    Is there a mechanism to recover from failures without data loss?

Review Procedure
The CDR follows this step-by-step process:

    Pre-Step: Machine Checks  
        Run cargo clippy --all -- -D warnings, cargo udeps, and cargo geiger.
        Address issues caught by these tools before proceeding.
    Initial Review (Pass 1)  
        Conduct static analysis using the checklist.
        Document findings in cdr_pass1.md, assigning grades (Red, Yellow, Green, Blue).
        Focus on Critical issues (e.g., data loss, infinite loops).
    Second Pass  
        After addressing Pass 1 issues, verify fixes in a second review.
        Reassess against the checklist for consistency.
        Escalate to additional reviews if Critical or Major issues persist.
    Additional Reviews (if needed)  
        Conduct further passes until all Critical issues are resolved and Major issues ≤ 2.
    Final Assessment  
        Compile a final report once Critical issues are resolved and Major issues ≤ 2.
        Approve progression, noting Minor or Informational items for future work.
    Feedback Loop  
        Require new unit/integration tests or linter rules for each Critical or Major issue to prevent recurrence.

Example Application to WFL Codebase

    Memory Leaks (e.g., debug_report.rs)  
        Check SafeDebug for Rc<RefCell<...>> handling in Value::List and Value::Object.  
        Grade: Major (Yellow) for potential leaks without immediate impact; Critical (Red) if systemic.
    Infinite Loops (e.g., repl.rs)  
        Assess run_repl loop for termination (CTRL-C or .exit). Ensure no input traps it indefinitely.  
        Grade: Critical (Red) if an infinite loop is possible.
    Data Loss (e.g., interpreter/environment.rs)  
        Examine Environment updates in define and assign. Confirm no unintended overwrites.  
        Grade: Critical (Red) if data loss is detected.

Conclusion
This CDR plan provides a systematic, repeatable evaluation of WFL’s design, prioritizing the detection and resolution of critical flaws like memory leaks, infinite loops, and data loss. With machine checks, defined reviewer roles, CI integration, and a feedback loop, it ensures WFL is robust and reliable for its intended applications.
