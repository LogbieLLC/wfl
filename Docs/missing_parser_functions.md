# Missing Parser Functions in WFL Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the parser functions and features that are not yet fully implemented or need improvements in the current WFL implementation. These missing features were identified based on errors encountered when parsing more complex files like `hello.wfl`.

## Missing Parser Functions by Category

### Container Access and Methods
- **Container Property Access**: Currently the parser lacks proper handling of dot notation for accessing container properties (`container.property`).
- **Method Calls on Containers**: There is no proper implementation for chained method calls on container objects.

### Named Parameter Function Calls
- **With Block Syntax**: The parsing for function calls with named parameters using the `with:` block syntax is implemented but may have issues.
- **Named Parameter Resolution**: The parser doesn't properly validate named parameters against function definitions.

### Collection Operations
- **List Indexing**: While basic indexing is supported, advanced index operations are not fully implemented.
- **Map Access**: The `at` keyword is supported but needs additional validation.
- **Collection Methods**: Parser doesn't fully support methods on collections.

### Import/Export System
- **Import Statements**: There's no implementation for parsing import statements.
- **Module System**: No support for module definitions and usage.

### Error Handling
- **Validation Blocks**: The parser has a `parse_check` function but no validation-specific syntax.
- **Try-Catch Error Handling**: The `parse_try_catch` function is defined but returns an error indicating it's not implemented.

### Advanced Features
- **Lambda Expressions**: No support for anonymous functions.
- **String Interpolation**: No support for embedding expressions in strings.
- **Container Construction**: The `parse_object_creation` method returns a placeholder error.

## Function Implementation Status

| Function | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| `parse_action_definition` | ðŸŸ¡ Partial | Structure exists but parameter handling may be problematic |
| `parse_container_creation` | ðŸŸ¡ Partial | Basic structure exists but may have issues with complex declarations |
| `parse_function_call` | ðŸŸ¡ Partial | Basic implementation exists but named parameter handling could be improved |
| `parse_collection_access` | ðŸŸ¡ Partial | Supports `at` keyword and bracket notation but needs enhancements |
| `parse_try_catch` | ðŸ”´ Missing | Returns a placeholder error |
| `parse_object_creation` | ðŸ”´ Missing | Returns a placeholder error |
| `parse_collection_initialization` | ðŸŸ¡ Partial | Basic structure for `set` keyword exists |
| `parse_list_literal` | âœ… Complete | Support for square bracket syntax |

## Implementation Challenges

### Type Compatibility Issues
There are inconsistencies between the parser's AST representation and the bytecode compiler's expectations:

1. **Action Definitions**: The parser's `ActionDefinition` has a different structure than what the bytecode compiler expects.
   - Parser: `Statement::ActionDefinition { name, parameters, return_type, body, is_async, is_private }`
   - Compiler: Expects an `ActionDef` type

2. **Container Definitions**: Similar inconsistencies exist for container definitions.
   - Parser: `Statement::ContainerDefinition { name, fields, methods, constructor }`
   - Compiler: Expects different field structure

3. **Function Calls**: Different representation of named arguments.
   - Parser: `NamedArgument` struct with optional name
   - Compiler: Expects tuples of `(String, Expression)`

### Error Recovery
The current error recovery mechanism using `synchronize()` is basic and could be improved:
- Only skips to statement boundaries (newlines or specific keywords)
- Doesn't handle nested expression errors well
- Doesn't provide detailed diagnostic information

## Implementation Priority

Based on the dependency structure and complexity, implementation should proceed in this order:

1. **Fix Type Compatibility Issues**: Ensure AST nodes match what the bytecode compiler expects
2. **Complete Basic Functionality**: 
   - Finish `parse_collection_access` and `parse_function_call`
   - Implement proper container property access
3. **Intermediate Features**:
   - Implement `parse_try_catch` for error handling
   - Complete `parse_object_creation`
4. **Advanced Features**:
   - Implement import/export system
   - Add lambda expression support
   - Add string interpolation

## Implementation Strategy

For each missing function, the implementation should:

1. Handle indentation and newlines correctly (using `match_token` for `TokenType::Newline`, etc.)
2. Provide clear error messages when syntax is invalid
3. Integrate with the existing AST structure
4. Ensure compatibility with the bytecode compiler

## Testing Approach

Test each implementation with:
1. Simple valid cases
2. Complex valid cases
3. Edge cases and error conditions
4. Integration tests with the bytecode compiler

## Conclusion

The WFL parser has a solid foundation but needs improvements in several areas to fully support the language design. By addressing the missing functions and resolving type compatibility issues, we can create a robust parser that integrates well with the bytecode compiler.
