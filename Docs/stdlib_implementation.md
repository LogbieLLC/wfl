# WFL Standard Library Implementation

This document describes the implementation of the WFL standard library as specified in the `wfl-stdlib.md` document.

## Overview

The standard library is implemented as a set of Rust functions that are registered with the WFL interpreter. These functions are organized into modules:

- **Core**: Basic functions like `print`, `typeof`, and `isnothing`
- **Math**: Mathematical functions like `abs`, `round`, `floor`, `ceil`, `random`, and `clamp`
- **Text**: String manipulation functions like `length`, `touppercase`, `tolowercase`, `contains`, and `substring`
- **List**: List manipulation functions like `length`, `push`, `pop`, `contains`, and `indexof`

## Implementation Details

### Function Naming Convention

Following WFL's principle of minimizing special characters, we've renamed functions to avoid underscores:

- `type_of` → `typeof`
- `is_nothing` → `isnothing`
- `to_uppercase` → `touppercase`
- `to_lowercase` → `tolowercase`
- `index_of` → `indexof`

For backward compatibility, we've kept aliases for the old names.

### Type Checking

The standard library functions are registered with the type checker to ensure proper type checking at compile time. Each function has a defined signature with parameter types and a return type.

## Testing Challenges

During testing, we encountered issues with the WFL parser's handling of function calls. The current parser implementation doesn't properly support function calls with arguments using the natural language syntax we attempted (e.g., `typeof of number value`).

The parser treats expressions like `typeof of number value` as variable names rather than function calls with arguments. This suggests that the parser needs to be updated to handle function calls with arguments using the natural language syntax that aligns with WFL's design principles.

## Future Work

1. **Parser Enhancement**: Update the parser to properly handle function calls with arguments using natural language syntax.
2. **Additional Functions**: Implement additional standard library functions as needed.
3. **Documentation**: Provide comprehensive documentation for each standard library function.
4. **Testing**: Once the parser is updated, create comprehensive test programs for all standard library functions.
