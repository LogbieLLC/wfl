# WFL Implementation Progress - 2025-04-17

## Lexer Implementation

- Implemented the WFL lexer using the Logos crate
- Defined token types for all WFL language constructs:
  - Reserved keywords (store, create, display, if, check, etc.)
  - Literals (boolean, nothing, string, integer, float)
  - Identifiers (including multi-word identifiers)
- Implemented handling for multi-word identifiers by merging consecutive identifier tokens
- Added position tracking for tokens (line, column, length)
- Created comprehensive unit tests for the lexer:
  - Multi-word identifiers
  - Literals and comments
  - Hello world program
  - Conditional statements
  - Loop statements

The lexer now successfully tokenizes WFL source code according to the language specification, handling:
- Whitespace and comment skipping
- Reserved keyword recognition
- String literals with escape sequences
- Numeric literals (integer and float)
- Boolean literals (yes/no/true/false)
- Nothing literals (nothing/missing/undefined)
- Multi-word identifiers

Next steps:
- Implement the parser to convert tokens into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
- Implement the bytecode compiler to convert the AST into bytecode
