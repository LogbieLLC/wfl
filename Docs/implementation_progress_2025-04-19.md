# WFL Implementation Progress - 2025-04-19
    
## Error Reporting and Diagnostics System
    
- Implemented a comprehensive error reporting system using the codespan-reporting library
- Created a unified diagnostic representation for different error types:
  - Parse errors (syntax errors)
  - Semantic errors (undefined variables, etc.)
  - Type errors (type mismatches, etc.)
  - Runtime errors (division by zero, etc.)
- Enhanced error messages with:
  - Clear, actionable descriptions
  - Source code snippets showing the exact location of the error
  - Helpful suggestions for fixing common issues
  - Specific guidance for missing keywords in variable declarations and assignments
    - Improved detection of missing `as` in `store` and `create` statements
    - Improved detection of missing `to` in `change` statements
    - Added contextual suggestions showing the correct syntax
- Updated the main compiler and REPL to use the new diagnostic system
- Added comprehensive documentation for the error reporting system
    
This implementation aligns with WFL's emphasis on helpful errors inspired by Elm, providing a more user-friendly development experience.
