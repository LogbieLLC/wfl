# WFL Compiler Implementation Progress

## Completed
- Initial setup of the tracking documents:
  - Created todo.md to track tasks
  - Created implementation_progress.md to track progress

## In Progress
- Examining the codebase to identify parser implementation and issues

## Next Steps
- Locate the parser implementation files
- Analyze container field access implementation
- Identify how scoping is handled for container methods

# WFL Implementation Progress

This document tracks the current implementation status of the WFL (WebFirst Language) interpreter.

## Components Overview

| Component | Status | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Lexer | ✅ Complete | Tokenizes source code into tokens |
| Parser | 🟨 Partial | Parses tokens into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) |
| Bytecode Compiler | 🟨 Partial | Converts AST into bytecode |
| Virtual Machine | ❌ Not Started | Executes bytecode |
| Standard Library | ❌ Not Started | Built-in functions and types |
| Test Suite | ✅ Complete | Comprehensive testing for all components |
| Documentation | 🟨 Partial | Language spec, developer docs, and tutorials |

## Detailed Status

### Lexer (✅ Complete)
The lexer successfully tokenizes:
- Keywords (define, container, action, if, else, etc.)
- Identifiers
- Literals (numbers, strings, booleans)
- Operators (+, -, *, /, >, <, etc.)
- Comments
- Brackets, parentheses, braces
- Special tokens (indentation, newlines)

### Parser (🟨 Partial)
Current Parser Features:
- ✅ Basic expressions (arithmetic, logical, comparison)
- ✅ Variable declarations
- ✅ Assignment statements
- ✅ If statements
- ✅ Check statements (partial)
- ✅ While loops
- ✅ Simple function calls
- ✅ Parenthesized expressions
- ❌ Container definitions
- ❌ Action definitions
- ❌ Collection literals and access
- ❌ Advanced function calls with named parameters

### Bytecode Compiler (🟨 Partial)
Current Bytecode Compiler Features:
- ✅ Basic expressions
- ✅ Variable declarations and assignments
- ✅ Control flow statements
- ✅ Simple function calls
- ❌ Container definitions
- ❌ Action definitions
- ❌ Collection operations
- ❌ Advanced function calls

### Test Suite (✅ Complete)
Current Test Suite Progress:
- ✅ Test directory structure created
- ✅ Test utility functions implemented
- ✅ Unit test framework for lexer, parser, and bytecode compiler
- ✅ Integration test framework for lexer-parser integration
- ✅ End-to-end test framework set up
- ✅ Complete test implementation for all components
- ✅ Automated test runner implemented

The test suite includes:
- Unit tests for individual component functionality
  - Lexer token recognition tests
  - Parser expression and statement tests
  - Container and collection parsing tests
  - Bytecode compiler tests for expressions and statements
- Integration tests for component interactions
  - Lexer-parser integration
- End-to-end tests for complete program execution
- Utility functions for test setup and result validation

### Documentation (🟨 Partial)
Current Documentation Progress:
- ✅ Language specification document created
- ❌ Developer documentation and code comments
- ❌ User tutorials and guides

The language specification includes:
- Complete syntax and grammar definitions
- Data types and expressions
- Statements and control flow
- Container system
- Actions (functions/methods)
- Collections and standard library
- Error handling
- Example programs

### Recent Progress (Documentation)
- ✅ Created comprehensive language specification document

### Next Steps (Documentation)
- Add inline code comments
- Create developer documentation
- Create user tutorials and guides

### Recent Progress (Test Suite)
- ✅ Set up test directory structure
- ✅ Created test utility functions for file handling and output comparison
- ✅ Implemented unit tests for lexer, parser, and bytecode compiler
- ✅ Created integration test framework for lexer-parser interaction
- ✅ Set up end-to-end test infrastructure with example tests
- ✅ Implemented comprehensive tests for all language features
- ✅ Created automated test runner

### Next Steps (Post-Test Suite)
- Focus on implementing the virtual machine
- Complete the parser implementation for container and action definitions
- Implement collection operations in the bytecode compiler
- Add type checking and optimization passes

### Recent Progress (Bytecode Compiler)
- ✅ Added missing OpCodes to support container operations
- ✅ Implemented scope and variable management functions
- ✅ Improved function call compilation with support for named parameters
- ✅ Added collection operations (lists, maps)
- ✅ Implemented indexing expressions for collections
- ✅ Completed container definition compilation
- ✅ Added action definition compilation

### Virtual Machine (❌ Not Started)
The virtual machine implementation has not yet begun. This will include:
- Instruction execution loop
- Operand stack
- Value representation
- Runtime environment
- Error handling

### Standard Library (❌ Not Started)
The standard library implementation has not yet begun. This will include:
- Core types
- I/O operations
- Collection manipulation
- Utility functions

## Example Program

The following is a simple example of what currently works:

```wfl
define variable x = 10
define variable y = 5

if x > y
    define variable z = x + y
    print z  # Simple function call
end if

define variable counter = 0
while counter < 5
    counter = counter + 1
end while
```

## Current Task: Adding Member Access Support (Dot Notation)

### Completed:
- Identified that the parser does not handle dot notation for member access
- Verified that `TokenType::Dot` is correctly defined in the lexer
- Found that the bytecode compiler has a placeholder for `Expression::MemberAccess` but it's not implemented

### In Progress:
- Implementing dot notation handling in `parse_primary` function

### Pending:
- Testing the changes with container member access
- Ensuring method calls work on member access expressions
