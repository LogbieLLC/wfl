# WFL Implementation Progress

This document tracks the current implementation status of the WFL (WebFirst Language) interpreter.

## Components Overview

| Component | Status | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| Lexer | ✅ Complete | Tokenizes source code into tokens |
| Parser | 🟨 Partial | Parses tokens into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) |
| Bytecode Compiler | 🟨 Partial | Converts AST into bytecode |
| Virtual Machine | ❌ Not Started | Executes bytecode |
| Standard Library | ❌ Not Started | Built-in functions and types |

## Detailed Status

### Lexer (✅ Complete)
The lexer successfully tokenizes:
- Keywords (define, container, action, if, else, etc.)
- Identifiers
- Literals (numbers, strings, booleans)
- Operators (+, -, *, /, >, <, etc.)
- Comments
- Brackets, parentheses, braces
- Special tokens (indentation, newlines)

### Parser (🟨 Partial)
Current Parser Features:
- ✅ Basic expressions (arithmetic, logical, comparison)
- ✅ Variable declarations
- ✅ Assignment statements
- ✅ If statements
- ✅ Check statements (partial)
- ✅ While loops
- ✅ Simple function calls
- ✅ Parenthesized expressions
- ❌ Container definitions
- ❌ Action definitions
- ❌ Collection literals and access
- ❌ Advanced function calls with named parameters

### Bytecode Compiler (🟨 Partial)
Current Bytecode Compiler Features:
- ✅ Basic expressions
- ✅ Variable declarations and assignments
- ✅ Control flow statements
- ✅ Simple function calls
- ❌ Container definitions
- ❌ Action definitions
- ❌ Collection operations
- ❌ Advanced function calls

### Recent Progress (Bytecode Compiler)
- ✅ Added missing OpCodes to support container operations
- ✅ Implemented scope and variable management functions
- ✅ Improved function call compilation with support for named parameters
- ✅ Added collection operations (lists, maps)
- ✅ Implemented indexing expressions for collections
- ✅ Completed container definition compilation
- ✅ Added action definition compilation

### Virtual Machine (❌ Not Started)
The virtual machine implementation has not yet begun. This will include:
- Instruction execution loop
- Operand stack
- Value representation
- Runtime environment
- Error handling

### Standard Library (❌ Not Started)
The standard library implementation has not yet begun. This will include:
- Core types
- I/O operations
- Collection manipulation
- Utility functions

## Example Program

The following is a simple example of what currently works:

```wfl
define variable x = 10
define variable y = 5

if x > y
    define variable z = x + y
    print z  # Simple function call
end if

define variable counter = 0
while counter < 5
    counter = counter + 1
end while
```

## Next Steps

1. Begin VM implementation
2. Implement basic standard library functionality
3. Add type checking to bytecode compiler
4. Add optimization passes to bytecode compiler
