# WFL Implementation Progress

## Overall Status

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Lexer | âœ… Complete | Tokenizes all language constructs including comments |
| Parser | ðŸŸ¡ Partial | Basic expressions and statements work, advanced features in progress |
| Bytecode Compiler | ðŸŸ¡ Partial | Basic functionality works, advanced features in progress |
| Virtual Machine | ðŸ”´ Not Started | Implementation pending |

## Lexer Status
The lexer is fully functional and can tokenize all language constructs, including:
- Keywords
- Identifiers
- Literals (string, number, boolean)
- Operators
- Delimiters
- Comments

## Parser Status

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Basic Expressions | âœ… Complete | Arithmetic, comparison, logical operations |
| Variable Declarations | âœ… Complete | Declaration and assignment |
| Conditional Statements | âœ… Complete | Check/otherwise statements |
| Loop Statements | âœ… Complete | For each, repeat while/until loops |
| Action Definitions | ðŸŸ¡ Partial | Basic structure parsed, needs testing |
| Container Definitions | ðŸŸ¡ Partial | Basic structure parsed, needs testing |
| Function Calls | ðŸŸ¡ Partial | Basic calls work, named parameters structure defined |
| Collection Operations | ðŸŸ¡ Partial | List/map initialization structure defined |
| Error Handling | ðŸŸ¡ Partial | Basic error reporting, needs improvement |
| Parenthesized Expressions | âœ… Complete | Supported for complex expressions |

## Bytecode Compiler Status

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Basic Expressions | âœ… Complete | Arithmetic, comparison, logical operations |
| Variable Declarations | âœ… Complete | Compiles variable declarations |
| Conditional Statements | âœ… Complete | Compiles check/otherwise statements |
| Loop Statements | âœ… Complete | Compiles loop constructs |
| Action Definitions | ðŸŸ¡ Partial | Structure defined but not fully implemented |
| Container Definitions | ðŸŸ¡ Partial | Structure defined but not fully implemented |
| Function Calls | ðŸŸ¡ Partial | Basic structure defined, incompatibilities with AST |
| Collection Operations | ðŸŸ¡ Partial | Structure defined but not fully implemented |
| Type System | ðŸ”´ Not Started | No type checking implemented yet |
| Error Handling | ðŸŸ¡ Partial | Basic compilation errors |

## Virtual Machine Status
The virtual machine implementation has not yet been started. This will be the component that executes the bytecode generated by the compiler.

## Current Challenges

### Parser-Compiler Integration
There are compatibility issues between the parser and bytecode compiler:
- Type mismatches in AST nodes and bytecode compiler expectations
- Missing implementation for several opcodes and utility functions
- Incomplete handling of complex language features

### Virtual Machine Implementation
The virtual machine needs to be implemented to execute the bytecode, including:
- Operand stack management
- Instruction execution loop
- Runtime value representation
- Error handling during execution

## Example Program

The following simple program works with the current implementation:

```wfl
# Simple variable declaration
store x as number 10

# Check statement (if/else)
check x > 5:
    # Simple expression statement
    x + 5
otherwise:
    x - 5
end check
```

## Next Steps

1. Complete the parser implementation for all language constructs
2. Fix compatibility issues between parser and bytecode compiler 
3. Implement missing bytecode compiler features
4. Begin development of the virtual machine
5. Add comprehensive error handling and reporting
6. Implement standard library functions

## Long-Term Goals

- Complete implementation of the WFL language as specified
- Develop a robust virtual machine with good performance
- Add debugging tools and developer utilities
- Create comprehensive documentation for the language
- Build a standard library of useful functions and containers
