// Test file for collection initialization and access

// List initialization using set syntax
set colors to:
    "red"
    "green"
    "blue"
end set

// Map initialization using set syntax
set scores to:
    "Alice" is 95
    "Bob" is 87
    "Charlie" is 92
end set

// Assign to a variable
store fruit as set to:
    "apple"
    "banana"
    "orange"
end set

// Collection access with 'at' keyword
store first_color as colors at 0
store bob_score as scores at "Bob"

// Collection access with bracket notation
store second_fruit as fruit[1]

// List initialization with brackets
store numbers as [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

// Access within expressions
store sum as numbers[0] + numbers[1]

// Nested collections
set nested to:
    "data" is set to:
        "values" is [10, 20, 30]
        "labels" is ["x", "y", "z"]
    end set
end set

// Accessing nested collections
store x_value as nested at "data" at "values" at 0
store y_label as nested["data"]["labels"][1]
