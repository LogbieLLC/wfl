## Core Language Concepts

### Variables and Data Types

#### Basic Values

```wfl
// Numbers
store count as 42                       // Whole number
store price as 10.99                    // Decimal number
store temperature as negative 5         // Negative number
store very large number as 1 million    // Large number
store tiny amount as 0.000001           // Small number

// Text
store name as "Alice"                   // Simple text
store message as "Hello, World!"        // Text with punctuation
store empty message as empty text       // Empty text

// Truth Values
store is active as yes                  // Yes/No value
store has account as no                 // Yes/No value
store is valid as true                  // True/False value
store is expired as false               // True/False value

// Special Values
store unknown value as nothing          // Nothing/null value
store not found as missing              // Missing value
store to be set as undefined            // Undefined value
```

#### Working with Variables

```wfl
// Creating New Variables
create new variable called count, set to 0
create new constant called PI, set to 3.14159

// Changing Variables
change count to 1
increase count by 5
decrease count by 2
multiply count by 3
divide count by 2

// Text Operations
join "Hello" and "World" into greeting
take first 5 letters from name
take last 3 letters from name
convert name to uppercase
convert message to lowercase
```

#### Collections of Values

```wfl
// Lists (Ordered Collections)
create list called shopping:
    add "milk"
    add "bread"
    add "eggs"
end list

// Working with Lists
add "butter" to shopping
remove "eggs" from shopping
clear shopping list

// Sets (Unique Collections)
create set called unique colors:
    add "red"
    add "blue"
    add "red"    // Duplicate automatically ignored
end set

// Maps (Key-Value Pairs)
create map called settings:
    theme is "dark"
    volume is 75
    notifications are on
end map
```

#### Complex Values

```wfl
// Records (Multiple Related Values)
create record called person:
    name is "John Smith"
    age is 30
    email is "john@example.com"
    is member is yes
end record

// Working with Records
get person's name
change person's age to 31
remove person's email

            does:
                set user store to store
                set cache to new "Cache" of type User with:
                    timeout seconds as 600
                end set
        end when

        define asynchronous action called "get user":
            needs:
                id as text
            gives back:
                user as User
            does:
                // Try cache first
                store cached user as perform cache "get item" with id
                check if cached user is not nothing:
                    give back cached user
                end check

                // Load from user store
                store user as await perform user store "load item" with id

                // Cache the user for future use
                perform cache "set item" with:
                    key as id
                    value as user
                end perform

                give back user
        end action
end container
```

### Control Structures

#### Loops

##### Count Loop

```wfl
count from 0 to 10:
    display "Iteration: " with count
end count

// With step value
count from 0 to 10 by steps of 2:
    display "Even number: " with count
end count

// Counting down
count from 10 down to 0:
    display "Countdown: " with count
end count
```

##### Collection Loop

```wfl
for each item in collection:
    process item
end for each

// With index
for each index and item in collection:
    display "Item " with index
end for each

// Reverse iteration
for each item in collection in reverse:
    process item from end
end for each
```

##### Conditional Loop

```wfl
repeat while condition is true:
    perform some action
end repeat

repeat until condition is true:
    perform some action
end repeat

repeat forever:
    perform continuous action
end repeat
```

##### Loop Control Features

- **Named Loops and Scoping**

  ```wfl
  count from 0 to 10 named outer loop:
      count from 0 to 5 named inner loop:
          check if inner loop count is 3:
              stop inner loop
          end check
      end count
  end count
  ```

- **Control Keywords**

  - `stop`: Exits the loop.
  - `skip`: Skips to the next iteration.
  - `pause`: Temporarily halts execution.
  - `resume`: Continues after pause.

- **Scope Qualifiers**

  - `inner` or `outer`: Specifies which loop in nested structures.
  - `current`: Refers to the immediate loop.
  - `all`: Affects all nested loops.

---

#### Check Constructs

##### Basic Check Structure

```wfl
check if condition is true:
    // Code block to execute if true
end check

check if condition is true:
    // Code block for true case
otherwise:
    // Code block for false case
end check
```

##### Multi-Condition Format

```wfl
check value:
    if value is above 100 then:
        // Handle high value
    if value is between 50 and 100 then:
        // Handle medium value
    otherwise:
        // Handle low value
end check
```

##### Pattern Matching

```wfl
check data matches pattern:
    type is one of "user" or "admin"
    id is a number greater than 0
    email is a string containing "@"
    settings:
        theme is one of "light" or "dark"
        notifications is a truth value
end pattern:
    process valid data
otherwise:
    handle invalid data
end check
```

##### Asynchronous Check

```wfl
check asynchronous operation with timeout of 30 seconds:
    while processing:
        if operation is pending:
            await delay of 100 milliseconds
            continue check
        if operation is complete:
            process result
            break check
        if operation has error:
            handle error
            break check
    end while
otherwise:
    handle timeout
end check
```

### File Operations

#### Core File Operations

```wfl
// Simple operations with smart defaults
read from "config.txt"                      // Quick read entire file
write "Hello" to "greeting.txt"             // Quick write
append "log entry" to "system.log"          // Quick append
delete "temp.txt"                           // Quick delete

// Explicit operations with options
read file "data.csv":
    mode is read only
    encoding is "utf8"
    line endings are "LF"
    buffer size is 8 kilobytes
end read

write to file "output.json":
    mode is write only
    create if missing
    encoding is "utf8"
    format is "pretty"
    indent with 2 spaces
end write
```

#### File Access and Security

```wfl
// Setting permissions
set permissions for "secure.txt":
    owner can read, write, and execute
    group "developers" can read and write
    others can read only
    inheritance:
        apply to new files
        propagate changes
    audit:
        log access attempts
        track modifications
end set

// Creating secure paths
create secure path from input:
    validate:
        no directory traversal
        within allowed roots
        matches allowed patterns
    normalize:
        resolve symbolic links
        convert to absolute path
        standardize separators
    verify:
        exists or is creatable
        has required permissions
        within size limits
end create
```

#### Encryption

```wfl
// File encryption
encrypt file "confidential.txt":
    algorithm is "AES-256-GCM"
    key from secure storage "main-key"
    store initialization vector with file
    compress before encrypting
    verify after encryption
end encrypt

// File decryption
decrypt file "confidential.txt.enc":
    algorithm is "AES-256-GCM"
    key from secure storage "main-key"
    verify integrity
    decompress after decryption
    validate content
end decrypt
```

---

### Error Handling

#### Error Handling Zones

```wfl
// Define zone-wide error handling
create error zone called "file processing":
    handle errors:
        when file is missing:
            try to create file
            if failed, notify admin
        when file is locked:
            wait up to 30 seconds
            then fail operation
        when permission is denied:
            try to elevate permissions
            maximum retries is 3
        when disk is full:
            try to free up space
            minimum free space is 100 megabytes
    end handle

    recovery steps:
        step 1: attempt auto-repair
        step 2: restore from backup
        step 3: notify administrator
        step 4: create incident report
    end recovery steps

    cleanup after error:
        remove temporary files
        release locks
        log error details
        restore original state
    end cleanup
end error zone
```

#### Operation-Specific Handling

```wfl
// Handling for specific operations
process file "important.dat":
    with error handling:
        when validation error:
            log details
            save invalid content
            notify reviewer
        when corruption detected:
            run repair tool
            verify integrity
            retry operation
        when version mismatch:
            migrate content
            update version
            verify compatibility
    end with

    with recovery:
        keep backups
        maintain versions
        allow rollback
    end with
end process
```

### Performance and Optimization

#### Buffering and Caching

```wfl
// Configuring a file buffer
create file buffer:
    size is 16 kilobytes
    strategy is adaptive
    prefetch is enabled
    monitor usage
end buffer

// Setting up a cache
create file cache:
    maximum size is 100 megabytes
    strategy is least recently used
    persistence:
        save to disk
        restore on start
        validate entries
    monitoring:
        track hit rate
        log performance
        alert on problems
end cache
```

#### Batch Processing

```wfl
// Processing in batches
process files in batch:
    source is "data/*.csv"
    batch size is 100
    parallel threads is 4
    memory limit is 1 gigabyte

    for each batch:
        validate files
        process content
        generate reports

        with progress tracking:
            update every 1 second
            show percentage complete
            estimate time to completion
        end with
end process
```

### Integration Points

#### Logging Integration

```wfl
// Integrating logging into operations
perform operation:
    log "Starting operation"
    if operation succeeds:
        log "Operation successful"
    otherwise:
        log error "Operation failed"
end perform
```

#### Monitoring Integration

```wfl
// Integrating monitoring into applications
monitor application:
    track metrics:
        response time
        error rate
        resource usage
    alert when:
        any metric exceeds threshold
        trend is concerning
end monitor
```

```wfl
repeat while interface is active:
    update display:
        if user input is received:
            process input
        if display needs refresh:
            update view
        if error occurs:
            show error message
    end update
end repeat
```

#### Background Tasks

```wfl
repeat in background:
    try to process queue:
        if queue is empty:
            wait for 5 seconds
        if new items are present:
            process items
        if error occurs:
            log error
            continue processing
    end try
end repeat
```
