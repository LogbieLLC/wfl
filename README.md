# WFL (WebFirst Language)

WFL is a programming language designed to be readable and intuitive, using natural language constructs to lower the barrier to entry for new programmers while still providing powerful features for experienced developers.

## Overview

WFL features a syntax that resembles English sentences, indentation-based structure, and modern programming concepts like containers (classes), actions (functions), and collections. The language is designed to be approachable for beginners while still being powerful enough for real-world applications.

## Project Status

The WFL compiler is currently under development. Here's the current status:

- âœ… **Lexer**: Complete - Converts source code into tokens
- âœ… **Parser**: Complete - Transforms tokens into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
  - âœ… Enhanced to support natural language function calls (e.g., `typeof of value`)
- âœ… **Semantic Analyzer**: Complete - Analyzes the AST for semantic correctness
- âœ… **Type Checker**: Complete - Performs static type analysis on the AST
- âœ… **Standard Library**: Complete - Core functions, math, text, and list operations
- ðŸ”„ **Interpreter**: In Progress - Will execute the AST directly
- ðŸ”„ **Bytecode Compiler**: Planned - Will convert the AST into bytecode instructions
- ðŸ”„ **Virtual Machine**: Planned - Will execute bytecode instructions

## AI-Assisted Development

This project is developed with the assistance of AI:

- **Devin.ai**: Primary AI developer responsible for core implementation
- **ChatGPT (GPT-4)**: Assisted with code reviews and optimization
- **Claude (via Cline)**: Assisted with documentation and architectural design
- **Grok**: Indirectly contributed to the project through knowledge base

The combination of AI assistance with human oversight has allowed for rapid development while maintaining high code quality and documentation standards.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Rust (latest stable version)
- Cargo (comes with Rust)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/logbie/wfl.git
   cd wfl
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```
   cargo build
   ```

### Usage

To run a WFL program:

```
cargo run -- path/to/your/program.wfl
```

Or, after building:

```
./target/debug/wfl path/to/your/program.wfl
```

## Standard Library

WFL includes a comprehensive standard library with the following modules:

### Core Module
- `print`: Outputs text to the console
- `typeof`: Returns the type of a value as text
- `isnothing`: Checks if a value is nothing (null)

### Math Module
- `abs`: Returns the absolute value of a number
- `round`, `floor`, `ceil`: Rounding functions
- `random`: Generates a random number between 0 and 1
- `clamp`: Constrains a value between a minimum and maximum

### Text Module
- `length`: Returns the length of a text string
- `touppercase`, `tolowercase`: Case conversion functions
- `contains`: Checks if a text string contains another string
- `substring`: Extracts a portion of a text string

### List Module
- `length`: Returns the number of items in a list
- `push`: Adds an item to the end of a list
- `pop`: Removes and returns the last item from a list
- `contains`: Checks if a list contains a specific item
- `indexof`: Returns the position of an item in a list

## Example WFL Program

```
store greeting as "Hello, World!"
display greeting

check if 5 is greater than 3:
  display "Math works!"
otherwise:
  display "Something is wrong with the universe."
end check

count from 1 to 5:
  display "Counting: " with the current count
end count

// Using standard library functions
store my list as [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
display "List length: " with length of my list
display "Type of list: " with typeof of my list
```
